# Air Quality Prediction Project
My air quality project using Python




## What is this?
I checked air data to predict when itâ€™s bad and suggest fixes.

## Why I did it
Bad air makes people sick and costs money. This helps cities plan better.

## How I did it
- Used Python to clean data and predict AQI.
- Made graphs with Matplotlib.

## Files
- analysis.ipynb: My Python code.
- air_quality_data.csv: Data file.
- aqi_prediction.png: Actual vs predicted graph.
- monthly_aqi.png: Monthly average graph.

## What I found
AQI is high in [month], suggest parks to cut it 20%.
